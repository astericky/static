While there are many many posts on Javascript and Object-Oriented Javascript all over the internet, I have never found a book that felt as concise and as thorough as this book is. I think many developers even experienced Java developers looking to get a better understanding of Javascript can really use this book to take their Javascript to the next level.

I would probably say that this book really serves as somewhat of a foundation for what will come in the future as it relates to Javascript.

Every chapter I felt like I was learning something I had not realized when working with Javascript before. Understanding primative types and reference types in Javascript is critical to understand how objects behave in Javascript and in other programming languages. The author starts the book out by explaining the difference between the two before getting into the details of functions and objects. You will learn about proper methods of detecting properties, instantiating built in types, call and apply.

I really enjoyed the fact that our author goes throught the trouble of explaining to us exactly what is going on behind the scenes. This gives developers more control over the code and how they are writing their code. He goes and explains this and the bind method.

Nicholas explains ECMA Script 5's built in Object functions by sprinkling in examples rather than going all dictionary style on us as many developer books typically like to do. People read books so they actually understand what they are doing better than they would if they were reading straight up documentation dictionary style. Explanation through example also gives us a tiny preview of how we might solve problems right now.

Chapter 5.... OH GAWD!... Chapter 5 and well really the whole book should be required reading for developers. I was hesitating on wether or not to give this book a 5 out of 5 stars. I went ahead and decided to give this book the full 5 because I don't have a recommendation as to how I might improve this book.

For all the praise Douglas Crockford's book 'Javascript: The Good Parts' gets, this book should be getting at least as much praise.
