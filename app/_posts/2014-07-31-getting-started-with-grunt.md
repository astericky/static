This book is among the best introductions to Grunt: The Javascript Task Runner and Nodejs platform I have seen to date. I was so pleased with this book that I recommended it to the other developers on my team immediately upon finishing this book.

The author immediately starts us out with creating a simple Grunt task. He explains the benefits of using a task runner at all in the development process. We learn why Grunt is an excellent choice for task runner in real world use cases such as code minification, code linting and code deployments.

Next we are guided through a more thorough set up of Grunt and the NodeJS platform. We learn about basic configuration and directory structure. The author does not stop there though. He walks us through installing grunt packages and plug-ins as well as building our own custom Grunt tastsk.

By the end of this book the author had me convinced that Grunt is the tool my team can leaverage at work to get control of our unweildy code base and get some structure and consistency around our deployment process.

Often times I find that beginner books are almost too beginner for the audience they are trying to target. This book really hits the sweetspot in terms of getting beginners set up quickly and easily without alienating more senior developers or going into the gory details of Grunt before developers have any real context or understanding around the problem Grunt attempts to solve.

One way I would improve this book is move the last 15-20 pages on development tools to an appendix of some sort. However, I would not include it as a part of a chapter titled Advanced Grunt.

Full disclosure: I was asked to do this review literally the day after I finished it. However, I've read this book and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.

I'm stunned that such a potentially boring topic could make for an amazing book.
