                <p class="article-excerpt"><p>Gulp is all the rage in the web development world these days. Of course someone had to rush to be first cash in on the Gulp popularity and quickly publish a book on Gulp hence ‘Developing A Gulp Edge’ was born. I have been tracking Gulp since about December 2013. I have tried to use it on several projects with only limited success.</p>

                <p class="article-excerpt"><p>‘this and Object prototypes’ is the second book in the ‘You Don't know Javascript’ book series. I would argue that this book probably could’ve served as the first book becuase this book challenges developers to actually re-consider the need of and use of the classical design patterns and assessing the benefits and drawbacks of it. In other words, it challenges developers to actually be engineers instead of just developers.</p>

                <p class="article-excerpt"><p>While this book attempts to demystify javascript scope and closures for javascript developers, it makes the topic mildly less mysterious. After reading this book, I think the explanation of both topics feels unfinished. I may go and re-read this book again. It is like The Good Parts without the immediately good even if controversial ideas in it.</p>

                <p class="article-excerpt"><p>While there are many many posts on Javascript and Object-Oriented Javascript all over the internet, I have never found a book that felt as concise and as thorough as this book is. I think many developers even experienced Java developers looking to get a better understanding of Javascript can really use this book to take their Javascript to the next level.</p>
