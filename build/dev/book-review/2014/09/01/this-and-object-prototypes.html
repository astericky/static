                <p>‘this and Object prototypes’ is the second book in the ‘You Don't know Javascript’ book series. I would argue that this book probably could’ve served as the first book becuase this book challenges developers to actually re-consider the need of and use of the classical design patterns and assessing the benefits and drawbacks of it. In other words, it challenges developers to actually be engineers instead of just developers.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that I and other developers have been lazy in that we just accept classical software design as the way software should be developed without really thinking about what that actually means and the benefits and drawbacks of classical design patterns. Rather than fully embracing the benefit of behavior based delegation-oriented design in Javascript, developers have typically shoe-horned in the classical design patterns into Javascript.</p>

<p>If you were even mildly disappointed in the first book in this series ‘Scope and Closures’, you will pleased to know that this book is head and shoulders better than the first book in this series and really is a shining example of what a good programming book should do is challenge you to think about software design in ways you had not previously really given much thought to.</p>

<p>Gone is the somewhat pretentious tone of the previous book. Instead the author takes a different tone as he aims to teach developers think about the implications of classical and behavioral design patterns. It is as if Kyle got better at writing a book that people can read and learn from. There are plenty of code examples along with detailed explanations of what Javascript is actually doing behind the scenes. This may actually just be a good computer science book to have in general. I am very happy with what I have learned from this book.</p>

<p>The last three chapters that compare classical vs behavior based design patterns in javascript really is worth the price of this book. This book is very well written and I think the last three chapters of this book has uses as a computer science topic in general and should not be limited to just a discussion about Javascript hence the 5 out of 5 stars I a giving it.</p>
