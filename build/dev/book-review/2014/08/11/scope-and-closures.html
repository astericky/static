                <p>While this book attempts to demystify javascript scope and closures for javascript developers, it makes the topic mildly less mysterious. After reading this book, I think the explanation of both topics feels unfinished. I may go and re-read this book again. It is like The Good Parts without the immediately good even if controversial ideas in it.</p>

<p>The author rather than try to fit in a full discussion on scope and closures elects to put additional information into an appendix which takes the reader away from very relevant and related questions that would likely further the readers understanding of the subject matter without having to skip all over the place. Usually, I tend to think of an appendix as off topic, related and useful information rather than a way to artificially keep the chapters short.</p>

<p>LHS/RHS scope explanation feels out of place being located in the first few chapters of this book. (Note: On some level I understand the logic of it being here.) Somehow I feel like its a complex theoretical topic being thrown at you right away before you have a solid context. The author probably could be more successful with explaining LHS/RHS scope by starting with day to day scoping problems developers have with their code now. Instead it comes off as too theoretical too fast and if you are not already well versed on compiler theory you can get lost right at the beginning of the book.</p>

<p>The question becomes are we trying to explain scope to developers who do not understand scope or are we trying to sound smart to developers who probably already understand scope.</p>

<p>The other thing I think is lacking with this book’s explanation of scope is this and passing scope around and executing functions in a scope outside of their own. Giving a full and in depth explanation if this is immediately useful in solving problems developers have everyday.</p>

<p>Lastly, the information on closures really only lasts for a chapter and then its really just a definition and showing off some common javascript patterns that closures rather than a full explanation of closures.</p>

<p>Ive read other reviews claiming the length is a plus but I feel like I would have liked those 20 pages they shaved off this book back. My review comes off as negative despite my 3.75 star review because I strongly feel like it could have been a 5 star book. There is great explanations in this book minus other great explanations that were left out of this book.</p>
