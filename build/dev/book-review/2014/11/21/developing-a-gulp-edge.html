                <p>Gulp is all the rage in the web development world these days. Of course someone had to rush to be first cash in on the Gulp popularity and quickly publish a book on Gulp hence ‘Developing A Gulp Edge’ was born. I have been tracking Gulp since about December 2013. I have tried to use it on several projects with only limited success.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to November 20, 2014 when I decided to start reading this book. The books first few chapters explain what Gulp is and what it is not. (Side Note: I did notice the fact that Safari in particular mobile Safari was ignored in the Javascript libraries section as it probably more than any other browser made developers reconsider how they are developing apps and websites for mobile and other devices.)</p>

<p>In any case, our authors describe the many benefits of using Gulp in comparison to other build systems. We learn about the benefits of build systems and about the 4 basic gulp commands.</p>

<p>Then we move on to actually getting npm, node, and gulp with the pizza-app example. This was a wonderful from scratch example. It really helps to seal in the benefit of reading a development book to have a well thought out tutorial that developers can bang on or play with. I did notice that when installing nvm a step was left out. (You need to run source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh right after executing the curl command to get this working.) Our authors guide us through some of the everyday tasks we need to run over and over again that get in the way of quickly developing sites/apps/modules etc… This had me hooked. I was building plug-ins and testing out things I could introduce at work. I stayed up until I had finished reading the entire book.</p>

<p>This book was a very pleasurable and productive read to be quite frank. I can use this in my workflow immediately. ‘Developing a Gulp Edge’ and the Kyle Simpson ‘You Don’t Know Javascript’ series made me appreciate development books and the authors of these books. They are more thorough than reading a random blog post on the subject many times. Developers are already working on their own projects and in many cases writing a book is a deviation from their other projects.</p>

<p>The authors could probably improve this book by updating some of the examples in this book. In particular, I would update the cache busting with gulp part of the book. I have not yet been able to find anything to cache bust a js file. The examples they provided with cache busting worked with everything but Javascript files. I would’ve also liked to see something about working with sprites as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we are walked through creating our own gulp plugin that does not actually do anything. It is good practice for those who intend to create a plugin.</p>
